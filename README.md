# CodeX
A dumb little programming language
This is a simple little language that I made after watching some video tutorials from howCode on YouTube.


What you can do:
-Type 'commands' to view commands
-Type 'time' to view date and time
-Type 'print {texthere}' to print stuff
-Type 'print x + y' to get an expression (and then an exception)
-Type 'mlg' for a random thing
-Type 'name' for another random thing
-Type 'about' to view information about CodeX
