# CodeX
A dumb little programming language.<br>
This is a simple little language that I made after watching some video tutorials from howCode on YouTube.

To use the program, CD to its directory using the command line, then run 'python3 codex.py yourfile.ext' with the yourfile containing the code you want to run. (You have to have Python 3.4)

What you can do:
-Type 'commands' to view commands<br>
-Type 'time' to view date and time<br>
-Type 'print {texthere}' to print stuff<br>
-Type 'print x + y' to get an expression (and then an exception)<br>
-Type 'mlg' for a random thing<br>
-Type 'name' for another random thing<br>
-Type 'about' to view information about CodeX<br>
